# Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 
# Example 1:
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 

# Example 2:
# Input: 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 
# Note:

# The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, n: int) -> int:
        binaryNum= bin(n).replace("0b","")


        binaryNum=list(binaryNum)
        s=''

        for i in range(0,len(binaryNum)):
            if binaryNum[i]=='0':
                binaryNum[i]=1
            else:
                binaryNum[i]=0
            s=s+str(binaryNum[i])

        result=int(s,2)
        return result
